APIv3SandboxLib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated controller classes accept the configuration parameters in their
respective constructors.

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a java library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a maven dependency in the generated pom.xml
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

For build process do the following:

    1. Open Eclipse and use "Import" option in "File" menu.
    2. Select "General -> Existing Projects into Workspace" option from the tree list.
    3. In "Select root directory", provide path to the unzipped archive for the generated code.
    4. Click "Finish" and ensure that "Project -> Build Automatically" option is enabled in the menu.

How To Use:
===========
Export the compiled classes as a java libray (jar). The exported jar can be used as library.
